# Exercise 04: Finding and Extracting Elements

## Move the reset to the elements file

Move the line where you import the reset file from
`sass/_overrides.scss` to the `sass/_elements.scss` file.

This is because the resets all affect elements.

## Extract the elements

Find the elements (styles on HTML elements like `body`, `h1`, `p`,
etc.) *that do not have classes or ids* and move them to the
`sass/_elements.scss` file.
