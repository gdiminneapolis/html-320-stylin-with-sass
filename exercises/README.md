# Working on the exercises

We are going to use a tool called "Prepros" to work on the exercises. You can download Prepros from https://prepros.io. The program costs $29 to buy, but you can download it for a trial without paying anything.

## Setting up Prepros

After you start up Prepros, from the hamburger menu in the upper left, select "Project Defaults". For the exercises, we'll be making the following settings default:

* Compiler Settings:
  * Sass
    * Output: "Relative to Source" and fill in "../sass"
  * Markdown
    * Turn off autocompile (uncheck it). For these exercises, the only Markdown files are the README instructions.

Close the settings pane by clicking on the left arrow at the top of the pane. You should be back in the projects view.

## Add exercise directories to the Projects pane

Opening up the exercises directory in Finder or Explorer, drag all the "exNN" directories onto the Projects pane.

## Working in your editor

You can open up the exercises directory in your editor to work on the exercises, or you can open up each individual exercise in your editor. You should definitely work on the directory, though, and not open individual files in the editor.
